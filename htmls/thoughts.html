                        <h4>Confucianism, Confucius</h4>
                        <p>
                            The three central points or ideas in Confucianism are parental or family devotion, proper or ritual behavior and humaneness. Confucius was a father of a nation; furthermore, his teachings(analects) have been had as much spiritual influence as a religion
                            does. In his vision, education or learning is crucial. Family comes first; however, right after it comes learning. From this it can be observed that education is a key factor as well as in person’s life and in a country’s fate.
                            The aim of learning is to foster ren (humaneness) through li(ritual decorum) so that learners can find and develop their dao (Way). Confucius claims that it is a pleasure to be able to use what one has learned. As an example
                            of a true learner, he takes Yan Hui, who was able to control his anger and never repeated his mistakes for the second time. Here, it can be said that if learned once one should not make a mistake on those things again. Additionally,
                            controlling anger also a part of humaneness. Therefore, humaneness comes with knowledge. To sum, education is the beginning of every benevolent undertaking. Confucius had certain strategies to govern a country. First was by
                            educating people. He was wise and knew that ignorance is in most cases the major reason of failures in the country. “A ruler who uses his virtue while ruling a state is like a polestar. He will show the right way. In addition,
                            one of his most important points in ruling a state was a non-violence approach to any issue and cause. He assumed that violence is always avoidable for a ruler. Moreover, the ruler can only use his wisdom and virtue to obtain
                            peace and growth in the country. Virtue of nobles is like a wind, and virtue of people is like a grass. When wind blows, grass bends! To govern a country, it’s not necessary to possess lands or to be a part of government. It
                            is enough to build one’s self in terms of morality and virtue and spread these among brothers, sisters, and friends. And that will be one’s contribution. Last but not least aspect to be mentioned is duties. Confucius says that
                            everyone should follow his or her duties and missions. Otherwise, there will be chaos. Minister should be a minister; king should be a king.

                        <h4>Stoicism, Marcus Aurelius</h4>
                        <p>
                            Life hardships have a variety of explanations in each teaching. For some, it can be an obstacle to overcome for salvation of a soul, for other hardships are nothing but a prescription of god in one’s fate. Life itself and its meaning are great questions
                            which have no answer and have myriad of different answers at the same time. When facing life tribulations, people prefer to look for calmness and relaxation in diverse ways. “Men seek retreats for themselves – in the country,
                            by the sea, in the hills – and you yourself are particularly prone to this yearning” claims Marcus in his “Meditations” (16). People, according to their inner agreement choose some of the ways to find courage and calmness during
                            hardships. Oftentimes, it is our mind that does not let us to make decisions because it is in chaos, it is not quiet. Therefore, Marcus suggests, first, calm down our mind (16). To calm down our mind we should find peace within
                            us, which literally means to retreat into one’s self. “No retreat offers someone quieter and relaxation than that into his own mind” (Meditations 16) states Marcus Aurelius emphasizing to inner side of a person. For human being
                            is a part of nature, part of a universe and universe is a kind of community, mankind should live in accordance with nature and universe. As Marcus was a proponent of Stoicism, for him, the agreement with nature was immensely
                            important.
