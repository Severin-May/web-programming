                    <p>Below, you will find book-reviews and quotes from the books I like the most. I prefer a good book to a good movie. Why? Because, I like to shoot my own film in my head by following the words on the pages of books. This practice enriches
                        my imagination. That is actually interesting to observe and compare my visualizations with the film shot based on a book. And I oftentimes find that books carry out more details.
                    </p>

                    <p>As you are here, why don't you pick up some book for yourself? And, yeah, all of the written things are just my subjective and analyzed opinion; hence, criticism is welcomed.</p>

                            I again visited the vast expanses of Afghanistan, the former-bright, lively, blooming in all its glory country. And then in Afghanistan - the country of thousands of tragedies. I listened to Sabur's fairy tales and parables, felt the loss of Abdullah's
                            sister, and enjoyed the view of Suleiman's house from Nabi's mouth. I watched from the window of my imagination the affection, friendship, and love between two men in the east - something that is rarely written about. I saw
                            a kind of revolt of a female poet in the country of a thousand-year patriarchy. The naive eyes of children who see or better to say, want to see only the good, heroic in the image of their parents. Rootless dervishes thrown
                            out of their once cozy warm hearth. And finally, I was so happy for the cosmic strength of some family ties - like between Abdullah and Pari, separated in childhood brother and sister, who found each other after half a century,
                            too late. Time does not spare. It was too sad to read how the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan are ruined because of the conflicts and wars. From time to time, unwittingly I found myself in the thoughts
                            that the God for real might have forgotten about this country. As I followed the story, the wonderful blooming flowers of Afghanistan turned into the ash. "The Kite Runner" and "A Thousand Splendid Suns" are the most beautiful
                            books. And this, the third book in a row, seemed to me a kind of extension of the two previous ones of Khaled Hosseini. There are many stories in this book - often sad ones. Look at Afghanistan from a different angle with this
                            adorable book.

                            Adolescence is not for nothing called a critical and difficult period for many people. This is the time when a person hesitates between two completely different worlds, when a person is most sensitive, when he sees the world in sharpened colors. The hero
                            of the work, Caulfield sees the good in people and for each person he finds a certain pity, a certain kindness. He is the man who hates the world by hook or by crook, and who does nothing to change it. He is a coward, he is
                            pathetic, he is incomparable in his feelings and completely stupid in his actions. He's lost, like so many of us. Caulfield is disgusted by Hollywood movies as everything shot in there is nothing, but a perfectly written up
                            story which has nothing to do with a writer's freedom, imperfectionism of life. He is against people to become the ones whom they are not just for the public's ovations and taps on the shoulder as if they truly mean something.

                            "Early cranes". I would probably have lived my life in vain if I hadn't picked up this book. I remember reading a small fragment of this book at school and thinking this book was just an average book, nothing more. Aitmatov is indeed a writer of a different
                            level. It seems that Remarque will concede his primacy to him. While I was observing Sultanmurat, he changed a lot - the hardships of life in wartime took their toll and knocked out millions of lives, including the life of
                            Sultanmurat. Youthful pure love, the value of friendship, responsibility for all the people who remained in the rear, harmony between human and animal - are the main topics of the work. Aitmatov, in one way or another, indirectly
                            or directly always touches on issues related to the world and the balance between nature and human being. A humanist who imbued his work with a love to humanity and mother nature. How much I would like to see this person at
                            least from afar at some meeting or conference, and catch the benefit and food for thought from the words flying from his mouth. It's been 13 years since his death, but let him stay alive inside of us.

                            This book, like many of the author's books, discusses the same problems of war, emigration, the destitute fate of people who sometimes could not even keep their name, people for whom the street became their home. The wanderers. In horribly inhumane circumstances,
                            his characters lose themselves, but find love and lose it, too. Living in the moment, but always having hopes for a bright tomorrow. The pain is drowned out by whiskey, and the wounds are forgotten by talking; conversations
                            short and long, full of sarcasm and humor. In the war times, if there were one thing that keeps a person alive, it would be humor. Humor makes you turn gray colors of surroundings into less gray with shades of other colors.
                            This is how a person survives. Philosophical questions are raised indirectly through the everyday problems that fell to the lot of the inhabitants of the bloody and cruel twentieth century. Philosophy and meaning are shunned
                            by all, for they have ceased to exist and to have meaning as they did in quiet times. Survival is the reason for everything, and the reason for the desire for survival is unknown. Either the instinct of self-preservation, human
                            greed, or love keeps life in these souls. Life is not a parable. You can go together for a long thousand and a thousand kilometers of roads full of horror and fear, and survive. And then separate your ways like two complete
                            strangers. And you also can not stop remembering a loved one and already dead person and look for connections with him in nothing. Even after the death of a person, you can hesitate who that person was for you, even sometimes
                            forgetting that the person has already died and it makes no sense to reason about his involvement in your life. Everything loses its meaning when a person dies, first of all for him, because he is no longer there, as if he
                            never existed. The pitiful signs of his former life fade and turn to gray ash. And even after all these years, you can still miss that person. Or you can commit suicide of the past "YOU" and know it as a rebirth of your "I"
                            and continue to live a little bit differently without pain and memories. Ah, if it were possible to commit suicide of the burdensome personality in us and change personalities as actors, we would be able to endure a lot, would
                            not we?
